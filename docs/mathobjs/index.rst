This documentation may also need to discuss vector spaces, manifolds,
fields, bases, and other higher-level constructs. In the future,
tensaur may also possibly address items such as pseudoscalars,
pseudovectors, pseudotensors, bivectors, quaternions, biquaternions,
other multilinear/Grassman exterior product multivectors.
